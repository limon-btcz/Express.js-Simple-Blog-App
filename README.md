# Express.js-Simple-Blog-App

Hi! It's a simple blog app. User authentications added. You can create post and add comment to post. I am also add CRUD operations. Nothing fancy just a simple blog app api for practice express.js with MongoDB.

First install all pacages. Simply run "npm install".

To start the app in development mode simply run "npm run start" in your terminal.

Thank you. Kiam Khan Limon limon0175@gmail.com
